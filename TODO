use console logs instead of prints

Make code run async - kind of done

Change the second url fetcher to make it more efective, make it run faster
maybe dont iterate trought all 5 pages, find whats blocking the next page button

TODO

Second api scraper may be done in more steps
not return 12k rows at once

get_url from requests refactor to use it twice
then modify the test for that method
