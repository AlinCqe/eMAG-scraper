Second api scraper may be done in more steps, not returning 12k items at once

Tests for scraper

Run it daily for preselected items/search words

In `data_extract_first_api` and others, `db_check_before_saving()` and `db_saving()` both access the DB per item. Try to batch query/check instead.

Scrape more data as link, reviews, photo...










query function move into db_config class

to dont save sets bundles that contains words like 4 x 50ml use regex, ask gpt


save price changes, see how toi save them, in same file? or each day differences in a separated one....
